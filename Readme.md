# Emogrify
Emogrifier is a PHP class that can inline CSS into HTML content. This is primarily for sending HTML emails programmatically with PHP.

The base source code for this project was copied from [Pelago Design](http://www.pelagodesign.com/sidecar/emogrifier/), mainly so it could be
stored on Github and distributed via Composer. Efforts will be made to keep this in sync with any updates from Pelago's version, but it's possible
that this version may diverge / improve.
